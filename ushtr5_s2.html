      <p><b>3.2.1 input Type color</b></p>

    The <b>color input type</b> (Fig. 3.1, lines 20–21) enables the user to enter a color. At the time
of this writing, most browsers render the color input type as a text field in which the user
can enter a hexadecamal code or a color name. In the future, when you click a color
input, browsers will likely display a <i>color picker</i> similar to the Microsoft Windows color
dialog shown in Fig. 3.2.

    <p> <h3>autofocus Attribute</h3></p>

The autofocus attribute (Fig. 3.1, line 20)—an optional attribute that can be used in
only one input element on a form—automatically gives the focus to the input element,
allowing the user to begin typing in that element immediately. Figure 3.3 shows autofocus
on the color element—the first input element in our form—as rendered in
Chrome. You do not need to include autofocus in your forms.

  <p><h3>Validation</h3></p>
Traditionally it’s been difficult to validate user input, such as ensuring that an e-mail address,
URL, date or time is entered in the proper format. The newHTML 5 input types
are self validating on the client side, eliminating the need to add complicated JavaScript
code to your web pages to validate user input, reducing the amount of invalid data submitted
and consequently reducing Internet traffic between the server and the client to correct
invalid input. The server should still validate all user input.
<p>When a user enters data into a form then submits the form (in this example, by
clicking the Submit button), the browser immediately checks the self-validating elements
to ensure that the data is correct. For example, if a user enters an incorrect hexadecimal
color value when using a browser that renders the color elements as a text field (e.g.,
Chrome), a callout pointing to the element will appear, indicating that an invalid value
was entered (Fig. 3.4). Figure 3.5 lists each of the new HTML5 input types and provides
examples of the proper formats required for each type of data to be valid.</p>
